# NFL, Here We Come: Using Machine Learning to Predict and Optimize Field-Goal Success

## What It Does

This project builds two complementary machine learning systems to analyze and optimize field goal performance in American football. First, a supervised learning model predicts the kicker-agnostic probability of a field goal being made based on historical NFL play-by-play data. Second, a custom reinforcement learning (RL) environment simulates field goal attempts under varying environmental conditions (wind, temperature, pressure, field surface, slip), and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent learns optimal kicking decisions (velocity, angle, aim). Together, these models provide both predictive analytics and policy optimization for field goal scenarios.
